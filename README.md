# jscpd-rs

Fast native Rust clone of [`jscpd`](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd).

The project goal is practical upstream compatibility with much lower runtime
cost: the same CLI/config/reporting workflows should work, while the detector
stays native Rust and does not embed or spawn JavaScript for core behavior.

The practical reason for the project is to make duplication checks cheap enough
to run often. Faster scans shorten local feedback loops, reduce CI/CD wall-clock
time, lower paid compute-minute usage, and cut the electricity spent on repeated
quality gates across large repositories and frequent pull requests.

## Status

This is pre-release software. The first release target is a coverage-first
compatible CLI replacement for common `jscpd` workflows:

- command-line and config compatibility for the upstream option surface;
- coverage-first duplicate compatibility: Rust must not miss duplicated lines
  reported by upstream on the same inputs/options;
- native built-in reporters: `ai`, `console`, `consoleFull`, `csv`, `html`,
  `json`, `markdown`, `silent`, `sarif`, `threshold`, `xcode`, `xml`, and
  `badge`;
- upstream-synchronized format registry with native JS/TS/JSX/TSX tokenization
  and generic native tokenization for long-tail formats;
- native blame support through Git;
- initial native Rust library API for running detection from paths or prepared
  in-memory sources.

Dynamic npm reporters, stores, listeners, and plugins are intentionally out of
scope for the first release. Unknown external reporters/stores keep
upstream-style warnings and continue where upstream continues.

## Install

Run with npm/npx:

```bash
npx jscpd-rs --version
npx jscpd-rs /path/to/source
```

The first npm package is a source-build package: install/postinstall compiles
the native Rust binaries with Cargo. A Rust toolchain must be available on the
installing machine. Prebuilt platform packages are a follow-up publication
improvement.

AI skills for duplication detection and guided refactoring:

```bash
npx skills add vv-bogdanov/jscpd-rs --skill jscpd
npx skills add vv-bogdanov/jscpd-rs --skill dry-refactoring
```

From this repository:

```bash
cargo install --path . --bin jscpd --locked
```

Build without installing:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin jscpd
cargo build --release --bin jscpd-server
```

## Usage

```bash
jscpd /path/to/source
jscpd --format typescript --min-tokens 50 --min-lines 5 src
jscpd --reporters json,html --output report src
jscpd --threshold 5 --exitCode 1 src
```

The CLI intentionally uses the upstream command name and help shape:

```bash
jscpd --help
jscpd --list
```

Start the native REST server:

```bash
jscpd-server /path/to/source --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health
```

The current server exposes `/`, `/api/health`, `/api/stats`, `/api/check`,
`/api/recheck`, and `/mcp`. The MCP endpoint supports the upstream server's core
tools and statistics resource over native JSON-RPC HTTP. Snippet checks reuse
the prepared project token maps refreshed by `/api/recheck`.

## Library API

The crate exposes the detector core for native integrations:

```rust
let options = jscpd_rs::get_default_options();
let result = jscpd_rs::detect_clones_and_statistic(&options)?;
let clones = result.clones;

let clones = jscpd_rs::jscpd(["jscpd", "src", "--silent", "--noTips"])?;
```

`detect_clones_and_statistics` is also available as the idiomatic Rust spelling.
`jscpd` and `jscpd_with_exit_callback` provide a native embeddable argv runner
similar to upstream `jscpd(argv, exitCallback?)`. `get_options_from_args` parses
upstream-style argv into normalized `Options` for native integrations.
`Tokenizer` provides a native generate-maps entrypoint over the same tokenizer
used by detection. `Detector`, `Statistic`, and `MemoryStore` expose native
counterparts for the main upstream core classes without loading JavaScript.
`detect_source_files` accepts in-memory `SourceFile` values, which is the
foundation for the upstream-style snippet/server workflow. Format helpers are
available through `get_supported_formats`, `get_format_by_file`, and
`get_format_by_file_with_mappings`.

## Compatibility Gates

Fast local gate:

```bash
scripts/release-gate.sh
```

Package/install gate:

```bash
scripts/package-check.sh
```

Npm package/npx gate:

```bash
scripts/npm-package-check.sh
```

Full compatibility matrix:

```bash
FULL=1 scripts/release-gate.sh
```

Public benchmark and coverage gate:

```bash
PUBLIC=1 PUBLIC_RUNS=3 scripts/release-gate.sh
```

Release candidate gate:

```bash
scripts/release-candidate.sh
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the fast gate on pushes and pull requests.
Manual workflow runs can enable the full compatibility matrix and public
benchmark suite before a release, or set `release_candidate=true` to run the
full release-candidate gate in CI.

Latest recorded public benchmark baseline:

| React | JavaScript | 0.192541s | 10.080165s | 52.35x |
| Next.js | TypeScript | 0.251140s | 14.383025s | 57.27x |

## Known First-Release Deviations

The first release is native-only and coverage-first. These differences from the
JavaScript package are intentional unless a real workflow proves otherwise:

- dynamic npm reporters, stores, listeners, and plugins are not loaded;
- token totals and exact clone pair ordering may differ from Prism-based
  upstream reports while duplicated upstream lines remain covered;
- HTML reports are self-contained and practically compatible, not pixel-perfect;
- the Rust crate exposes a native API, not the upstream JavaScript package API.

## Development

The upstream repository is checked out as the `jscpd/` git submodule and is the
executable specification for behavior.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo test
```

Useful focused checks:

```bash
scripts/compat-cli.sh
scripts/compat-config.sh
scripts/compat-reporters.sh
STRICT=coverage scripts/compat-matrix.sh
```

Known upstream bug candidates and intentional compatibility exceptions are
tracked in [docs/upstream-bugs.md](docs/upstream-bugs.md). GitHub-ready issue
drafts are prepared in
[docs/upstream-issue-drafts.md](docs/upstream-issue-drafts.md).
